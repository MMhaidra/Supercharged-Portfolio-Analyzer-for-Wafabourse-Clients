# 📊 Supercharged Portfolio Analyzer for Wafabourse Clients

Welcome to the notebook that turns your Wafabourse portfolio PDFs into a **beautiful, instant dashboard—so you finally get ALL the answers their web platform won’t show.** 🚀

## 🚦 What does this notebook do?

- **Reads your exported portfolio statement PDF** from Wafabourse.
- **Automatically extracts all your stocks and investments**—no matter how many pages or weird table columns.
- Calculates everything:
    - 💰 Actual gain/loss for every position (not just the portfolio total)
    - 🎯 Your best and worst stocks, instantly
    - ⚖️ Portfolio weights, risk-return ratio, and top-5 concentration
    - 📈 ROI, total invested vs. current value, everything in one summary
- **Creates rich, interactive plots**:
    - 🍩 Pie charts of allocation
    - 🏆 Winners & Losers bar charts (with fun coloring!)
    - 🗺 Treemaps, donuts, scatterplots, and more
- **Gives you a pro-level analytics table** with custom formatting—because you deserve better than “just numbers in a PDF”!

## 🤔 Why use it instead of the Wafabourse platform?

- Wafabourse: “Here’s your portfolio. No, you can’t see all your gains per stock. No, you can’t get a real breakdown.
- **This notebook**: “Here’s EVERYTHING: every gain, every loss, rankings, weights, risk analysis, and even a handsome dashboard—plus colors and charts that make sense!” 😎

## 🧪 How does it work?

1. **Drag your latest Wafabourse PDF** into the `data/` folder.
2. **Run all cells in the notebook.**
3. **Enjoy:** interactive charts, detailed tables, and a full analytics summary will appear, all without any manual copy-paste.

## Bonus: Some Unnecessary Fun
- Your worst stock is roasted in red.
- Your portfolio winner gets a virtual gold medal.
- P&L is bright green if you’re up (if not, it’s at least honest!).
- Pie charts and bar labels so clear, even your cat would get them.
- Superhero-style emojis throughout (because investing is serious, but your report doesn’t have to look like a tax form).

## 📦 Features

- ✅ Works even on PDFs with extra columns or fun French accents.
- ✅ Cleans up data, skips headers/footers, and banishes summary rows to oblivion.
- ✅ Plots and table styles fit for a presentation (or a post bragging on social media).
